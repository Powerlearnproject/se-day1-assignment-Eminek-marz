# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is syystematically appling engineering principles ,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems
importance of software engineering  in the technology industries:
software engineering enables the creation of software application  in every aspect of human way of life and the daily acitivity wher applied to.
for example it is used in communication e,g whatsup,commerce in predicting the stock exachange ,health care to analyse data and research for various subject in human health

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the  developmments of programming languages e.g c programming languages ,the establishment of the software engineering as  a discipline in  1960s and the good principles of better programming led tothe advancement in better structerd programming in the 1970s and the  rise of agile methodologies in  the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements 
where the developer gathers  and document the users needs  and systemrequirements
2. Design
the developer creates the high level  and detailed of software  architecture e.g the componets ,the connectors e.t.c and  friendly user interface
3. implimentation 
here we as the development take the intitives of building the software by writing codes based on the designed that we come up with.
4.Testing
conducts various test for quality softaware 
5.deployment/releasing
presenting the software to the clients
6.Maintenance
provide the ongoing support ,updates and  enhancements
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is the sequential while agile  is iterative and incremental

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
responsible for writing codes and implemeting software soltion
Quality Assurance Engineer
Ensure the qualityof the software by running the test
Project management
Oversees the overall structure and architecture of he software systems

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive tools for debugging and testing codes e.g visual studio code
VCS are software tools that tracks changes to source codes and cordinating work among members doing the same project eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requiremnts 
solution is to research expansively and update the already made softwares
tight deadlines
reasses the projrcts goal and timlines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.)

Unit Testing; Tests individual components or units (e.g., functions, methods) in isolation.
Integration Testing ;Tests the interaction between integrated units or modules.
System Testing;Tests the complete, integrated system as a whole
Acceptance Testing; Tests the system against user requirements and business needs.


.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
crafting the questions and  instruction to get the best solutions from the robot and Ai modules
the importance;
increse the accuracy and the efficiency of the robot  and AI modules

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'describe something interesting'
'describe the most intersting story for an eight year old'
the improved prompt is the specific  and categorizes the story to a specific group of individuals
